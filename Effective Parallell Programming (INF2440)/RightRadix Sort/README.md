# Sort an array by using Right-radix sorting algorithm.
This was the foruth mandatory assignment in Effective Parallell Programming
I have created both a parallell and sequential soloution to the problem.
My program runs both soloutions 7 times and compares the result.

How to compile & run:

javac *.java

java oblig4 <amount of numbers to generate(also ceiling for numbers)> <number of cores to use (0 = all)>
