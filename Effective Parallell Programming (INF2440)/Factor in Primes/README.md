# Factorization in primes

This project finds primes up to N, and thereafter factors the 100 biggest numbers from N*N-100 to N*N

It runs both a sequential and parallell soloution 7 times and compares the median result times.

How to compile & run:

javac *.java

java oblig3 <n> <cores to use (0 = all)>

My program will thereafter ask if you want to check if the soloutions got the same result.

P.S: Check out report.pdf for more details.
