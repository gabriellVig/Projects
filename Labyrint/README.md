# Labyrinth assignment from INF1010 with GUI

How to run:

javac *.java

java gridPaneTest

A window will pop up, choose one of the files named Labyrint[1-6].txt

My program will then read the labyrinth from the file.

Click on any of the white buttons on the screen to make my program solve the labyrinth from that node.
