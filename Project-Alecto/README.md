# Project-Alecto
Trying to develop an android app.

The app is based upon tasks & categories.
Tasks can be parents of other tasks.
Categories can be parents of other categories.
Tasks do not need to belong to a category (Can be undefined)
Tasks can belong to multiple categories.
Root-tasks can belong to multiple categories because the child-tasks can belong to different categories.
